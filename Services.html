<h3><font color="green">To be admitted for service, all PetsHotel and Day Camp clients must be at least 4 months old. Some pets may not be allowed at Paws Saloon's discretion.</h3>
<h3><font color="green">We recommend bringing your pet's own food, which we will feed free of charge, to keep his or her stomach happy. Additional charges apply if you want us to serve them our house brand of food. Paws Saloon makes it simple to give your dog or cat a delightful retreat for an overnight or longer period of time when you need to be away. PetsHotel provides a secure and comfortable home away from home for pets of all ages and stages of life. With Standard Guest Rooms, for example where dogs can bunk with friends, Private Suites, and Kitty Cottages for your beloved felines, it's the ideal pet hotel for boarding your pets.</h3>
<h3><font color="green">Our PetsHotel provides on-site care 24 hours a day, seven days a week, as well as twice-daily exercise walks and unrestricted toilet breaks. Individual playtime is enjoyed by cats on a daily basis. Bring your pet's food and treats from home, or we may feed them for a charge. For an extra price, medication dispensing services are also offered.</h3>

<h3><font color="green">Whether you have a puppy, an elderly dog or cat, or a rescue, Paws Saloon pet training lessons can teach them how to behave properly at home and on the move. Positive reinforcement is used by our certified pet trainers to offer enjoyable and effective group and private sessions.</h3>
<h3><font color="green">We can help you and your pet set limits and communicate in ways you both understand with adult dog or cat training sessions. We provide three levels of pet training courses, with advanced abilities such as special feats and therapy pet training available to experienced pet parents and graduates.</h3>
<h3><font color="green">We also provide personalised lessons for pets and their owners. If socialisation is vital to you, however, our group classes are ideal. They're small enough (4-10 pets) that you'll get the attention you need, but they also give your pet plenty of opportunity to learn how to listen to you while being around other pets or distractions.</h3>
